### Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

To deploy the website - I commited to github and started the process of pushing
to git hub.  I git add . ; git -m "commit content"; git status; git push to remote.  Many times due to local issues with cloud9 not being compatible with my server, I had to reset to previous commits. I was unable to preview and as a result made many mistakes and unnecessary changes.
Fortunately I am able to git log then set to a previous commit on github.

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
